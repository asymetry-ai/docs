# Asymetry SDK

> **Zero-code observability for OpenAI & Anthropic text workloads** – built for modern LLM Ops.

Asymetry is a comprehensive observability platform for text-based LLM applications. Our Python SDK automatically instruments your OpenAI and Anthropic calls, captures detailed telemetry, and provides security analysis to help you build safer AI applications.

<Info>
Asymetry focuses exclusively on **text-based LLM tracing**. We capture prompts, completions, and all text interactions with full fidelity.

## Why Asymetry?

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="wand-magic-sparkles" title="Automatic Instrumentation">
    Just call `init_observability()` and we automatically capture all your OpenAI and Anthropic API calls. No code changes to your existing LLM logic required.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="chart-line" title="Rich Telemetry">
    Capture everything: latency, token usage, prompts, completions, errors, and trace correlations. Get complete visibility into your LLM operations.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="shield" title="Security Analysis">
    Automatically detect prompt injection attempts, jailbreaks, PII exposure, and toxic content. Get risk scores for every interaction.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="layer-group" title="OpenTelemetry Native">
    Built on OpenTelemetry for seamless integration with your existing observability stack. Custom tracing for your business logic with decorators and context managers.
